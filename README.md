# Building-Recommender-System
create a recommendation system using Python, the data used here is the film database from imdb complete with its metadata


The code-based research gives vital insights into understanding film data and ratings. We began by cleansing the data, removing items with NULL values in critical variables such as primary title, original title, and genre. This is necessary to ensure that the data we utilize in the study is of high quality.

The movie table and rating table are then combined. We can observe how film ratings connect to other factors like title, genre, year of release, and film length by combining them. This opens the door to developing a more accurate and tailored recommendation system.

Following that, we construct a basic recommendation system based on the average rating (C) and the number of votes (m). The value of C represents the average rating of all films, whilst the value of m is utilized as a threshold for the number of votes required for the films included in the suggestion to be considered popular. We may build a list of suggested films based on the highest ratings using this technique.

However, we also allow users to customize their settings. Users may select whether they want films that are solely for adults or not, the year the film was released, and the kind of film they are interested in using the "User Preference Recommender" tool. The algorithm will propose movies based on those preferences, allowing viewers to locate fascinating films that fit their interests and tastes.

Finally, this research presents an outline of how film data and ratings may be used to create an accurate and personalized recommendation system. Users may identify fascinating films based on the highest ratings and their preferences using this technique. This investigation gives useful insights into understanding and leveraging data to deliver a better and more pleasurable movie viewing experience.
